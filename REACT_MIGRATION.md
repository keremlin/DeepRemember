# React Migration Guide

This document describes the incremental migration from vanilla JavaScript to React.js for the subtitle player application.

## Migration Strategy

The migration follows an **incremental/hybrid approach** where:
- Existing pages remain functional as-is
- React components are embedded where interactivity is needed
- Vanilla JS functionality is preserved alongside React components
- Gradual migration allows testing and validation at each step

## Mental Model Changes

### Stop Doing:
- Manually querying and mutating the DOM (`getElementById`, `innerHTML`, `appendChild`, `addEventListener` for UI updates)
- Direct DOM manipulation for state changes
- Manual event handling for complex interactions

### Start Doing:
- Describe UI with JSX
- Keep UI in sync with state and props
- Let React update the DOM automatically
- Use React's component lifecycle and hooks

## React Components

### 1. SubtitleDisplay.jsx
- **Purpose**: Displays subtitles with interactive word clicking
- **Features**: 
  - Word tooltips with translations
  - Add to cards functionality
  - Real-time subtitle updates
- **Props**: `subtitles`, `currentSubtitleIndex`, `onWordClick`

### 2. PlaylistComponent.jsx
- **Purpose**: Manages playlist of uploaded files
- **Features**:
  - File listing with metadata
  - Play and delete actions
  - Real-time updates
- **Props**: `onPlayItem`, `onDeleteItem`

### 3. CardReviewComponent.jsx
- **Purpose**: Handles spaced repetition card review
- **Features**:
  - Card display and answer reveal
  - Rating system with keyboard shortcuts
  - Progress tracking
- **Props**: `cards`, `currentCardIndex`, `onAnswerCard`, `onShowAnswer`

### 4. CreateCardModal.jsx
- **Purpose**: Modal for creating new learning cards
- **Features**:
  - Form validation
  - Similar words search
  - AI translation integration
- **Props**: `isOpen`, `onClose`, `onCreateCard`, `currentUserId`

## Integration Helper

### ReactIntegration.js
Provides utilities for mounting React components into existing HTML:
- `mountComponent(component, containerId, props)`
- `updateComponent(containerId, newProps)`
- `unmountComponent(containerId)`

## Testing the Migration

### 1. Test React Integration
Visit `http://localhost:7000/test-react` to verify React components are working correctly.

### 2. Test Hybrid Pages
- **Main App**: Visit `http://localhost:7000/hybrid` to test the subtitle player with React components
- **DeepRemember**: Visit `http://localhost:7000/deepRemember-hybrid` to test the learning system with React components

### 3. Compare Functionality
- Test all interactive features work the same as original
- Verify appearance remains unchanged
- Check that keyboard shortcuts still work
- Ensure API calls function correctly

## Migration Benefits

### Immediate Benefits:
- **Better State Management**: React components manage their own state
- **Improved Performance**: React's virtual DOM optimizes updates
- **Code Organization**: Components are self-contained and reusable
- **Easier Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation

### Future Benefits:
- **Easier Maintenance**: Component-based architecture is more maintainable
- **Better Developer Experience**: React DevTools for debugging
- **Scalability**: Easier to add new features as React components
- **Modern Ecosystem**: Access to React ecosystem and libraries

## Rollback Strategy

If issues arise, you can easily rollback by:
1. Using original routes (`http://localhost:7000/` and `http://localhost:7000/deepRemember`)
2. Original JavaScript files remain unchanged
3. No database or backend changes required

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** on both hybrid pages
2. **Gradually migrate** more components to React
3. **Consider migrating** to a full React SPA when ready
4. **Add React Router** for client-side routing
5. **Implement state management** (Redux/Zustand) for complex state

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "react": "^18.0.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
  "@babel/standalone": "^7.0.0"
}
```

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- React 18 requires browsers with native ES6 modules support
- Fallback to vanilla JS for older browsers

## Performance Considerations

- React components only re-render when props/state change
- Virtual DOM diffing optimizes DOM updates
- Components can be lazy-loaded for better initial load times
- Consider code splitting for larger applications
